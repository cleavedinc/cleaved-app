              agree that any dispute, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right
              arising out of these Terms or otherwise, shall then be settled exclusively by arbitration as set forth

              Requirement. All claims, controversies, disputes and other matters in question arising out of, or relating
              to these Terms, the breach hereof or the rights, privileges, responsibilities or duties between or among
              you and Cleaved, shall be decided by confidential arbitration in Deleware, USA in accordance with the
              Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then existing, unless all
              parties to any such claim, controversy or dispute, or other matter in question, unanimously agree to the
              contrary. The provisions contained in this Paragraph shall be specifically enforceable under the
              prevailing arbitration law.

              persons with experience in the social media business, selected in accordance with the AAA's Commercial
              Arbitration Rules then in effect. The parties will be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with the
              provisions of Deleware's applicable code of civil procedure. The remedial authority of the arbitrator or
              arbitrators will be the same as, but no greater than, would be the remedial power of a court having
              jurisdiction over the Parties and their dispute. The arbitrator or arbitrators will render a written
              opinion based on Deleware law, and specifying an award, which will be final and binding upon the Parties.
