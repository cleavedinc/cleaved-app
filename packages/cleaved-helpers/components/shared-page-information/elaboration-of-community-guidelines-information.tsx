//           <Bold>Spam</Bold> Spam is repetitive content that does not contribute relevant, solicited substance to the
//           conversation, but instead prevents others from getting their message out. It is most disruptive in comments. A
//           member's own comments can also qualify as spam, especially when they make frequent, irrelevant use of
//           hashtags, or other members' handles. Such deceptive uses of hashtags and community member handles result in
//           the flooding of a tag feed, or of a member's notifications feed, with repetitive or irrelevant content. While
//           serial spamming is a violation of these Guidelines, we encourage our community members to first unfollow the
//           offender before reporting spammers.

//           unsolicited, unrelated advertisements, comments on others' posts.
